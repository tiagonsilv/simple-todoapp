# simple-todoapp
This was my first ever project, I made it back in _2021_.

I decided to revisit it and add some much needed features that might make this actually usable.

### Implemented:
- New design
- Ability to edit existing tasks by double clicking
- Ability to mark tasks as complete
- Button to clear all tasks
- Confirmation for clear all tasks button

### What's coming:
- Dark mode
- Ability to reorganize tasks by dragging and dropping
